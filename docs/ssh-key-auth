SSH Key-Based Authentication (Windows → Raspberry Pi)

This guide shows how to configure SSH key-based authentication to securely access a Raspberry Pi from a Windows machine, avoiding password-based login.

1. Generate SSH key pair on Windows

Open PowerShell on Windows:

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "windows-to-raspberry"


When prompted:

Press Enter to accept the default path

Optionally set a passphrase (recommended)

This creates:

Private key → ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

Public key → ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

View the public key:

type $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_ed25519.pub


Copy the entire line (starts with ssh-ed25519).

2. Access the Raspberry Pi (password login – first time only)
ssh enrico@RASPBERRY_IP

3. Prepare SSH directory on Raspberry Pi

On the Raspberry Pi:

cd ~
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh

4. Add the public key to authorized_keys
nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys


Paste the public key copied from Windows, then save and exit.

Set correct permissions:

chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

5. Test SSH key authentication

From Windows:

ssh enrico@RASPBERRY_IP


✅ If login works without asking for a password, SSH key authentication is correctly configured.

6. (Optional but recommended) Harden SSH security

Edit SSH config:

sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config


Set or ensure:

PasswordAuthentication no
PermitRootLogin no
PubkeyAuthentication yes


Restart SSH:

sudo systemctl restart ssh

Security Notes (Why this matters)

Eliminates password-based brute-force attacks

Private key never leaves the client machine

Strong file permissions (700 / 600) prevent key leakage

Follows Linux and DevSecOps security best practices
